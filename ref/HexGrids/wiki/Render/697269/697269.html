<div class="wikidoc">Easy! Define your map transposed, with the hex-grain vertical, and set the <b>IsTransposed</b> flag in <b>HexgridPanel</b>. Whenever a mouse-point is supplied by the user, execute the code shown here to transpose it into the map frame of reference as shown here:<br /><pre>
protected override void SomeMouse_Event(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) {
  var location = TransposePoint(e.Location);
  // etc.
}
</pre><br />Searching on the string <i>IsTransposed</i> in the example code shows how easy it is. The <b>Transpose</b> button in the sample demonstrates this.<br /><br />Note that transposing a map moves the provided Custom Coordinates&#39; origin to the upper-right from the lower-left. This can be compensated for by replacing the default Custom Coordinates conversion matrix with its transpose.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
