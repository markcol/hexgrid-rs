However I am still looking at a possible parallel implementation, which would require the Concurrent implementation.",

    "Description": "This is a *breaking change*, though one I believe will be worth the pain. The project has been substantially reworked while being fully integrated to the library as used in my gaming engine. The gaming engine now uses the code exactly as published here, which will help to ensure that this publication is kept up-to-date.\n\nI believe the current code is more robust, and easier to read and use, as a result of the integration. Some dead code has been removed, and several minor enhancements incorporated. (*Mouse-wheel zoom* and *mouse-wheel scrolling* two of the latest, though I frankly forgot to keep track.)\n\nOne change of note is that *Path Finding* now supports two modes, selected by setting *PathFInder.RangeCutoff*. The original algorithm, which maintains agent orientation to target but runs somewhat slower, is used at ranges less than or equal to this value; a faster algorithm which does not maintain agent orientation to target is used at greater ranges. The Line-of-Sight limit is a convenient value to use for the cut-off.\n\nThe difference is whether *DictPrioirtyQueue* or *HeapPrioirtyQueue* is used to maintain the Open List for the A-* implementation. The former provides a stable sort, maintaining the agent orientation, while the latter does not.\n\nAdditionally, the *MIT Licence* for this project has been properly incorporated into all source files, as well as being available on disk as a text file.",
