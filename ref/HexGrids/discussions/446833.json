    "Html": "The field-of-view is calculated in 30 degree segments (dodecants)). If your requested cone comprised a subset of whole dodecants, then passing in a mask of live dodecants would perform exactly what you are looking for. The code would only need to be tweaked to accept and use such a mask as a parameter.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you need more precision than that, a start and stop vector would need to be passed in. The code currently doesn't support that, but it is next on the project list after I finish tuning path-finding. I will need that functionality myself for my own game engine. What is your time line for needing this?<br />\n",
