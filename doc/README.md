# Notes

Both Star Fleet Battles and Wooden Ships & Iron Men use a flat-topped hexagon map with the origin at the top left, using odd-offset numbering.

Star Fleet Battles uses a coordinate naming system, where each hex is numbered based on a two digit representation of x and y position concatenated into a single 4-digit coordinate name. (0101, 0102, etc.)

Wooden Ships and Iron Men uses a letter-digit representation, where the X coordinate is represented as a Letter, and the Y coordinate is represented as a number. (A1, B1, ... AA1, etc.)
